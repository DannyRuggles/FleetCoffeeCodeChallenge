This repository contains two Java files: FirstNonRepeatedCharacter.class and Main.java. The FirstNonRepeatedCharacter.class file contains the compiled bytecode of the FirstNonRepeatedCharacter class, which provides a method to find the first non-repeated character in a given string. The Main class contains a main method that demonstrates the usage of the FirstNonRepeatedCharacter class.

FirstNonRepeatedCharacter.class
The FirstNonRepeatedCharacter.class file contains the compiled bytecode of the FirstNonRepeatedCharacter class. This class has a static method firstNonRepeated that takes a string as input and returns the first non-repeated character in the string. If no non-repeated character is found, it returns an empty string.

Main.java
The Main.java file contains the Main class, which serves as the entry point of the program. It demonstrates the usage of the FirstNonRepeatedCharacter class by calling the firstNonRepeated method from the FirstNonRepeatedCharacter class with a sample input string and printing the result.

Method
main(String[] args): This method is the entry point of the program. It creates a sample input string, calls the firstNonRepeated method from the FirstNonRepeatedCharacter class (using the compiled bytecode in FirstNonRepeatedCharacter.class), and prints the result.

Feel free to modify the input string in the Main.java file to test the firstNonRepeated method with different inputs.
